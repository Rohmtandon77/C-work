/*
Student records will be stored in a Student class.Â  
Student records contain a unique student ID (an integer), 
a string name field, a string level field (Freshman, Sophomore, etc.),
a string major field, a double GPA field, and an integer advisor field, 
which will contain the Faculty ID of their advisor. 
These are the only fields the class contains.

The Student class must overload equality, less than, greater than operators, etc. 
so that we can compare them to one another.
